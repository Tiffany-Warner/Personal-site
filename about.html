          <p>Hi there!<br /> I was born and raised in Arizona and I currently
            reside in Flagstaff, AZ. I'm a full-time student at Oregon
            State University as part of their Ecampus program for Computer
            Science. I am projected to graduate by December 2018.

        <h4> A Little About My Background</h4>
        <p>I was always fascinated by how things work which is what drew me
          to biology. The human body, especially the nervous system, and
          everything else in the world has a structure and is part of a complex
          system. It’s the job of scientists to figure out exactly how it
          all works and then manipulate or utilize those mechanisms to do
          something great for the world. After graduating from Grand Canyon
          University with a B.S. in Biology, I went to work for a medical
          device manufacturing company. Here, I got to be part of a process
          that was involved in saving people’s lives. It was here that I was
          first exposed to engineers and engineering. It became very clear to
          me that the engineers were the people who spent most of their time
          trying to figure out how to create and manipulate processes,
          machines, and software to make our process easier, more efficient,
          and more error-proof.

      <h4> Why Computer Science?</h4>
      <p>Software played a huge part in this. Anytime a new software technology
        was implemented, the efficiency of the process was drastically improved.
        For some unknown reason, I had always assumed coding would be outside
        the scope of my abilities. It wasn’t until I decided to go back to
        college to pursue an engineering degree that I first got introduced to
        coding with a MATLAB course from Northern Arizona University. It was by
        far my favorite course because I felt like between me and my computer,
        I had the power to create something from anywhere at anytime. A simple
        dice game was my favorite project. I was so proud of this tiny little
        program. For years, I’ve been drawing as a hobby. As an artist, I
        always felt so proud knowing I brought something
        into existence. I created something.

        <p class="special">I got this same feeling when I created that dice game.</p>
        <p>
          I had to learn more. So, I started searching for the best options to get a
          C.S. degree and that’s when I found Oregon State University’s Ecampus C.S degree.
          OSU has been ranked in the

          several years in a row. All exams were proctored and it had a great reputation.
          I knew I could get a solid education and the quarter system provided the flexibility I needed.
